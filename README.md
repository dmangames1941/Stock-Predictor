# Stock Predictor IPYNB(Interactive Python Notebook)

Project by Dalton Corriher

## What is the Stock Predictor Notebook?
This Interactive Python Notebook uses a Long short-term memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithm to predict a stocks closing price.

### How to run?
In order to run this file, my recomendation is downloading it and opening it up in Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). When it opens copy and paste the GitHub URL found here: [](). After that I would recommend clicking on the ==Runtime== tab and click ==Run all==. After it connects to the kernel you will be promped to enter a stock ticker which is the abreviation for the stock you want to use the model on. This can be found here [https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/). Next you will be asked to input the number of days of data that will be used to train the model. The default is 60 which you can use by just pressing the enter key on your keyboard. The program will take about 5 minutes to full train and produce a result for the stock. After a result is produced you can continue predicting for different stocks. Enter done instead of a ticker to get a summary of the predictions and end the program.
